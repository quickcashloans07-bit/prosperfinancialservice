    question: "How fast can I get funded?",
    answer: "Our automated system allows for instant approvals in many cases. Once approved, if you securely link your bank account, funds can be deposited in as little as 45 minutes or the next business morning.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you check my credit score?",
    answer: "To view your customized rates and terms, we only perform a 'soft pull' which does not affect your FICO credit score. A hard inquiry is only made once you officially accept the loan terms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any prepayment penalties?",
    answer: "No. We believe in rewarding responsible financial behavior. You can pay off your loan as early as you'd like without any hidden fees or penalties.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Bank Authentication?",
    answer: "Bank Authentication is a secure way for us to verify your income and banking details instantly. It uses 256-bit encryption and is entirely read-only, meaning we cannot make changes to your account. This removes the need for uploading paper documents.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of loans do you offer?",
    answer: "We offer Personal Loans ($2k-$35k). The product has terms specifically tailored to your use case.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I make my monthly payments?",
    answer: "The easiest way is to set up AutoPay during your application. We will automatically deduct your fixed monthly payment from your linked bank account on your due date, helping you avoid late fees.",
  },
